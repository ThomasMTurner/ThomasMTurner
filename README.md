## About Me

My name is Thomas Turner, a student of Computer Science at the University of Bath. In my first year, I built various technically involved personal projects, requiring dedication and independent research, e.g. [a search application and engine implemented in Rust and Python](https://complexity314.substack.com/p/devlog-1-the-joy-of-search-part-1) using the [document clustering method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_clustering). Further, with the supports and talents of fellow students Matthew Connolly, Ayushi Mahajan, and Mitchell Heath - [we were awarded Hacker's Choice at the Bath Hack 2024 competition organised by the Bath Computer Science Society (BCSS)](https://devpost.com/software/cypher-a40yxq#updates) for a LLM application which generates and displays comedic diss tracks about photographed participants. The following summer, I gained experience in Computer Vision and Machine Learning in Roke Manor Research's Futures department - focused on synthetic data generation and object detection. The following academic year, I chaired and began to build up the small Bath Artificial Intelligence Society - an ongoing project which I transferred to the brilliant [Saad Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saadahmed02/) for 2025-26, and contributed to [Team Bath Racing Electric's AI subdivision](https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/team-bath-racing-electric-aiming-for-european-success/) by enabling local and global path planning functionality for embedded self-driving. Currently, I am an intern in ARM's Developer Advocacy division, developing Machine Learning featured applications and optimising neural networks for ARM-based hardware, and voluntarily contribute as a Technical Lead in full-stack development for EDEN (Employment Devices Enhancing Neurodiversity). Furthermore, [I write periodically in various topics concerning my experiences with ADHD, technology, neuroscience, philosophy, and the works of Emmanuel Swedenborg](https://substack.com/@mycer?utm_source=user-menu).
